Very minimalistic app.\
Created with Firebase. Uses Firestore Database\
Don't mind the spaghetti ;)\
I regret not using angular or something lol. its pretty much pure jquery/vanilla js.\
If youre interested in trying it out, just create a project on firebase, its free. dont forget to change the keys in app.js\
heres the schema of orders collection
```javascript
{
  board_id:int,
  order_number:string,
  order_date:timestamp,
  ship_date:timestamp,
  receive_date:timestamp
}
```
